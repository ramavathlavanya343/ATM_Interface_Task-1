DOMAIN:C++ PROGRAMMING

DESCRIPTION:This project is a basic ATM interface created using C++. It allows a user to perform simple banking tasks like checking balance, depositing money, withdrawing money, changing the PIN, and exiting the system. The user must first enter a correct 4-digit PIN to access the menu. If the wrong PIN is entered three times, the program exits. The features are built using a C++ class that stores the user's balance and PIN. The interface is menu-based and easy to use. All data is handled within the program, and no files are used. This project helps in understanding how C++ can be used to create simple real-life applications using classes and functions.
